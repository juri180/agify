# Agify

A simple Flutter application that estimates a person's age by name, based on the Agify API.

<sub>The Agify API is accessible via https://agify.io/.</sub>

## Getting started

As for any other Flutter app, the same applies here: execute

```
flutter run
```

from the command line to start the application on one of the available devices.

Tested on Android and iOS.
